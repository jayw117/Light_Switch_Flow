# Light_Switch_Flow
Given a floor plan with n switches and lights, check to see if a line can be drawn between a switch and light. There can only be one switch per light. The line can only be drawn 
if there is no wall in the way. Using Ford Fulkerson algorithm check to see if the floor plan is ergonomic (Each swtich can be seen by a light) or if it is not ergonomic.
